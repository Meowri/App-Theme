This week's project is to study the app-theme tutorial from Traversy Media.

-You are expected to submit your code from his tutorial in a new repository generated from this starter template. 
-Your repository should be named app-theme and should be cleanly developed with one branch per step. 
-It's up to you to write the development strategy!

You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, and the completeness of your repository. Your repository must contain:

-A README describing your project in detail.

-One well-named branch per user story. 
-If we check out any branch, it should contain only the code necessary to make that step work. and it should work!
-A file called development-strategy.md in which you explain how you broke the project into user stories, describe each user story, and describe what code you wrote to implement this user story.

Two-Stepping: First - follow the tutorial studying the code and understanding the project. Second - go through the tutorial another time, this time around focusing on using branches to create a finished repository.
One-Stepping: Follow the tutorial once more slowly, carefully building your finished repository as you go.
